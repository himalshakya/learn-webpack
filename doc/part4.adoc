== Loaders, CSS and SASS

*https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/[Loaders,window=_blank]*

Loaders are transformations that are applied to the source code of a module. They allow you to pre-process files as you import or “load” them. Thus, loaders are kind of like “tasks” in other build tools and provide a powerful way to handle front-end build steps. Loaders can transform files from a different language (like TypeScript) to JavaScript or load inline images as data URLs. Loaders even allow you to do things like import CSS files directly from your JavaScript modules!

To add css loader and style loader

[source,bash]
----
npm i -D style-loader css-loader
----

we also need to edit the config file

[source,javascript]
----
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [{
      test: /\.css$/i,
      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'], # <1>
    }],
  },
};
----
<1> The order is reversed 'css-loader' is loaded first then 'style-loader'

We also need to add main.css to the index.js

[source,javascript]
----
import run from './app/app';
import AlertService from './app/alert.service';
import ComponentService from './app/component.service';
import './main.css';

run(new AlertService(), new ComponentService());
